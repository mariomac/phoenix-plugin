# Code Review Guidelines

## Core Principles
Review code changes with focus on quality, security, and maintainability.

## Specific Rules

### Error Handling
- Check for proper error handling and ensure errors are not silently ignored
- Verify error messages are descriptive and actionable

### Documentation
- Ensure all public functions and methods have documentation comments
- Check that complex logic includes inline comments

### Security
- Look for potential security vulnerabilities:
  - SQL injection risks
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  - Hardcoded credentials or secrets
  - Improper input validation
- Ensure API endpoints have proper authentication and authorization

### Code Quality
- Verify proper variable and function naming conventions following the project style guide
- Check for code duplication and suggest refactoring opportunities
- Look for overly complex functions that should be broken down

### Testing
- Ensure new features include appropriate unit tests
- Verify edge cases are covered in tests

### Dependencies
- Verify that dependencies are up-to-date and do not have known vulnerabilities

### Concurrency
- Look for race conditions in concurrent code
- Check proper use of synchronization primitives

### Logging
- Check for proper logging at appropriate levels (debug, info, warning, error)
